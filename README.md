Alexa - JWO Fun Facts
=====================

The non-award winningest Alexa App ever published regarding Fun Facts for JWo!

Hints for future people:

1. You need to use lambda-local to run "Events" against your code locally.
2. You get sample events from Amazon Alexa app online.
3. Once those works, and only then, should you zip it up and try to get on Amazon Lambda.

### TODO

1. Add ability to search for a specific fact.
2. anything ?
